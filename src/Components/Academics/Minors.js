              <h3>Minor Specialization</h3>
              <p>
                Students who are willing to excel in some specialization other
                than his/her own department, have the option for doing a Minor
                specialization in that department. Earlier, one needed to have a
                CGPA{">"}7.5 to opt for a minor. Recent changes have scrapped
                this rule, however, a limit on the number of students in a
                course might be imposed. It consists of 4-8 additional courses
                equivalent to 18-30 credits that need to be taken up in the
                pre-final and the final year of college. Also, it is not
                necessary for the specialization to belong to the same
                discipline of study and it may be taken from any one of
                engineering, management, science and humanities. The most recent
                addition to this basket was a minor in Economics. Before the
                beginning of every semester, courses being offered for a
                particular minor specialization are floated and students have to
                pick up a few from that basket. These courses are called Minor
                Specialization Courses and have a fixed number of seats. For the
                people who successfully fulfill the required credits have the
                name of the minor specialization aptly mentioned on their degree
                they receive upon graduation.

              <h3>Departmental Honours</h3>
              <p>
                The basic structure of Departmental Honours is similar to Minor
                Specialization. Students with interests in their own department
                and having a CGPA greater than 7.5 can take 4-5 extra courses
                from their department and pass out with an Honours degree. The
                courses for gaining an honours degree are floated before the
                beginning of every semester by the concerned department and are
                called Departmental Honours Courses. Similar to Minors, a
                student passing out with an Honours will have it mentioned in
                his degree.

              Switching to an Integrated Dual Degree Program(IDD) from BTech
              Program
            </h3>
            <p>
              Students at the end of their 3rd year are offered an option to
              switch to an integrated dual degree program (BTech + MTech). The
              MTech degree choices are unique to the studentâ€™s BTech branch and
              they depend on whether it satisfies the required eligibility
              criteria. This option to switch is offered only to the students
              having a CGPA greater than 7.5 and an approval from their
              respective departments.
