          IIT Roorkee creates an environment that fosters the growth of
          intellectually capable, innovative, and entrepreneurial professionals.
          Students at IITR believe in following their passion. The Presence of
          various technical and cultural groups helps them to get a taste of
          multiple flavors in life. All the hard work and sacrifices done for
          JEE is paid off by the aura of the lush green campus. The institution
          is located on the banks of the Ganga canal in the foothills of the
          Himalayas; it ensures the best experience with serene surroundings.
          Surprisingly it even has a Himalayan Explorer's Club, the only IIT in
          India to have so. Meritious students with AIR below 250 get the
          prestigious James Thomson Scholarship. Since its establishment in
          1847, Asia's first technical Institute has played a vital role in
          providing the finest technical expertise and know-how. It ranks among
          the best technological institutions globally and has also been
          considered a trend-setter in education and research among science,
          technology, engineering, education and research.
